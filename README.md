# UnitTestExample
Using the code from Stanford Course to practice learning Unit Testing using XCTest.

I want to learn Unit Testing and then Test Driven Development. I know this is important, but it's not "cool" as far
as a lot of tutorial sites go. They all want to make "apps like [[fill in popular app here]]". On top of that, all the
great tutorial and code learning sites have just about abandoned Objective-C. I'm not knocking Swift, but I will
focus more on it when either 

A. The ground beneath me quits moving when I write in it. In other words, you figure
something out, Apple fixes some bugs, and none of your code compiles. I can't count the time all my "?"s turned into
"!"s. I still keep an eye on Swift, but I need to know how to Test more than I need to know Swift.

or
B. Someone offers me a job and says, "ummm yeahh, it would be great if you could do this in Swift, thanks a bunch. Now
where's my TPS reports? Yeeaahhh, thanks." (Ode to Bill Lumberg) :]

So yep, this is my Unit Testing Example repo. I'm making it public because I don't want to take up all my private 
repos.
